# Can we build a site that serves the needs of our open spaces board?

# Desirable Characteristics of the stickies
- Common, physical location for people to meet/discuss topics
- No training required for people to write an idea and throw it on the board

# Characteristics of the site
- Automatically synced for everyone
- Can track interest in a topic
  - This can help highlight an overbooked time slot
- Automatically find a spot

# Don't make a digital version of stickies, unless it serves the UX

# View

## Who are you?
- Name
  - Can we do this in a way where their password is automatically generated and saved in browser?

## Main Menu
- Submit a topic
- View topics
- View schedule

## Submit a topic
- Form
  - Topic

## Schedule a topic
- Topic title needs to be visible
- Can we show rooms and time slots simultaneously, while remaining phone-friendly?

## Schedule a slot?
- Worth having this perspective, or can we use topic-based scheduling only?

## View Topics
- Highlight/filter based on whether or not you have expressed (dis)interest
- Live updates
  - This is an "optimization" that I consider critical to this being useful

## View Schedule
- Quick view of the days topics by default
  - This feels like one of the most important views
- Lock days that are too far in the future?
- Show intensity of interest visually
    - Could just be a count
  - Probably not color based, as that can be hard to see for some people

  ### Edit Schedule
  - Not sure if this is a distinct area, or a version of the View Schedule
