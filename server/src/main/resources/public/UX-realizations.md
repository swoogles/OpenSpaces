# Bad Ideas

- Going into a "Reschedule" mode
  - This used to be a 2 step process
    - Discussion would be removed from the schedule and selected/pending only in the Front-end
    - Then you would select a new room slot to attempt scheduling
      - If anything disrupted you in between these steps, the topic would just get dropped and left in the "Unscheduled" pool

- Swapping discussions between slots must be a single step, otherwise you have the same downside above, but worse.
